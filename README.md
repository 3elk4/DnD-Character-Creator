WPF desktop application to keep all DnD Characters' info in one place.

## Character

Character is build from five sections - main Info, feats, proficiencies, items and bio. In the future it is planned to add combat actions and spell info to character.

Skills are divided in four sections based on abilities: skills from intelligence, wisdom, charisma and physics abilities. Main character level is sum of all classes' lvls (max four classes).
